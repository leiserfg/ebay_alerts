#+TITLE: Ebay Notifications


* Tecnologies
** Backend
- django as core web framework (ORM, mail client, templates...)
- django rest framework for rest implementation
- drf-yasg for api documentation 
- huey as task queue and scheduler
- django-environ for configuration loading
- ebay-sdk as ebay client
** Frontend
- React as view library 
- mobx as state manager
- portable-fetch as http client

* Considerations
- The server is configured to run on port 8000
- The frontend is precompiled for easier setup but you can rebuild it if you want
- The api is browseable on /api/swagger/  or /api/redoc/
- /ebay_task/.env is a configuration file with some vars (and comments) that you can tweak (email backend, db ...)
- Even though it is a system without auth you shouldn't see the emails of other customers, so i use UUID as primary key for avoid iterations over the api.
- In the emails is style are embedded 'cause the email readers don't like to read css from outside.
